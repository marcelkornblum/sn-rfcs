title: Signal Noise ways of working
---

This site hosts the RFCs for the Signal Noise organisation, that together define the approaches and tools that we take to create our work.

The idea is that we create high quality code, structured in an accessible way which is easy to reason about -- all while minimising the impact on everyone's personal way of working.

Please jump into a specific RFC below:

* [0002 Tooling - Linting & Formatting](./text/0002-tooling-linting-formatting)
