title: Signal Noise ways of working
---

This site hosts the RFCs for the Signal Noise organisation, that together define the approaches and tools that we take to create our work.

The idea is that we create high quality code, structured in an accessible way which is easy to reason about – all while minimising the impact on everyone’s personal way of working.

You should start by reading about our [Git Workflow](./text/0001-git-workflow) and the associated [CI/CD approach](./text/0003-continuous-integration.md).

When you're working on a project with Javascript, please follow the [Linting and Formatting](./text/0002-tooling-linting-formatting) guide. If you're setting up a new project you'll probably need to read about [hosting](./text/0004-hosting.md) as well.

For reference, all the approved RCFs are listed here:

* [0001 Git Workflow](./text/0001-git-workflow)
* [0002 JS Tooling - Linting and Formatting](./text/0002-tooling-linting-formatting)
* [0003 Continuous Integration](./text/0003-continuous-integration.md)
* [0004 Hosting](./text/0004-hosting.md)
